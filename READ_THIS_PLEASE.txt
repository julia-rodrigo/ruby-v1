I am a student experimenting with Godot for my final year project.
Most of what I learnt here are references from youtubers 
trying to teach on the same field. 

Therefore 80% of the code is NOT mine, I have copied through the 
videos with some basic understanding, but fully. 
There will be some errors.

This code is a short demonstration of how the battle system, using my sprites.

------------------------------------

To run the code:
Please install Godot


Open the project in Godot.

Click the top right corner to the video play icon on the rightmost
{
    type into Search:       Battle.tscn 
}

Open 'Battle.tscn'
Wait for the screen to load.

There should be a battle scene.

Press the middle bar to continue the dialogue.
And proceed to hit the black buttons.

When one character health goes down, then the game ends onto the world screen
Use your keypad to move the character behind the Sign

This is all thats available.

-----------------------------------------

Sprites: these sprites are all mine
They are found in the folder: 'res://import/'

Thank you for your time.
